# Project Assessments
I did not know how to make a flexbox before doing this assessment, i went to this website:
https://dev.to/drews256/ridiculously-easy-row-and-column-layouts-with-flexbox-1k01 

and used their code to first create the flexbox, i then re labeled the classes and id's to what made sense to me
in the HTML, and i did the same to all the CSS id's and classes. I applied:
```
display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
```
to all the id's that needed them, I made borders around all the columns and rows to be able to see what I was changing and made
the changes I needed to make the flex look like the example.

## JavaScript

I first made variables for each of the inputs, the count which is in the second row, second column and the counter which is in the first row second column. I added event listeners to the plus and minus button and when clicked would add 1 to the counterResult's value.
